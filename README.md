## Business Problem
The company faces challenges in:
- Identifying the most profitable product categories and regions.
- Managing logistics and shipping efficiency.
- Improving profitability despite strong sales numbers.
- Understanding how customer segments and regions contribute to revenue.
The goal is to use data-driven insights to increase profitability, streamline shipping, and optimize sales strategies.

## Data Analysis & Insights
### 1. Sales Performance
- Total Sales: $742K with  an 11% YoY growth.
- Profit: $18.5K but with a 57% YoY decline, indicating increased costs or discounting.
- Quantity: 8K units sold, reflecting an 8% YoY increase.

### 2. Sales Trend
- Peak Sales Month: December ($121.8K), showing strong end-of-year demand.
- Suggests potential for seasonal promotions in Q4 to boost revenue.

### 3. Shipping Mode
- Most Used Mode: Standard Class (59%) — cost-effective but slower.
- Faster Modes (Same Day, Second Class) are less utilized, which might affect customer satisfaction in urgent deliveries.

### 4. Shipping Duration
- Most Orders (28%) delivered within 4 days — indicates reasonable logistics efficiency.
- However, delays beyond 5 days (17%) could be optimized to improve customer experience.

### 5. Product Category
- Highest Sales Category: Chairs ($328K) followed by Furnishings and Tables.
- Suggests focus on maintaining inventory and marketing for high-demand categories.

### 6. Geographic Insights
- Top State: California ($156K) — the largest sales contributor.
- Other top-performing states include Texas, New York, and Washington.
- Indicates concentration in urban and coastal markets.

## SWOT Analysis

|-----------|------------|
|Strong overall sales growth.|Declining profit margins despite higher sales.|

## Conclusion
The furniture business demonstrates strong sales momentum and solid customer demand, especially in the chairs category and California region.

- Customer Retention: Use loyalty programs and delivery satisfaction surveys to improve repeat purchases.
